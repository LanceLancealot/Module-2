          About me: Greetings! I'm Maxfield, and I hail from the charming town
          of Plymouth, Michigan. My fascination with computers and technology
          has been the driving force behind my journey into the world of web
          development. Having pursued an Electromechanical Technology Associates
          Degree from the Michigan Institute of Aviation Technology, I've
          cultivated a strong foundation in technical disciplines. Currently,
          I'm immersed in a dynamic learning experience through Michigan State
          University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, where I'm honing my skills
          and exploring the vast realm of web development. While I haven't yet
          specialized in any specific programming languages, my insatiable
          curiosity fuels my quest to master various tools and techniques.
          Although I haven't embarked on major projects, I approach challenges
          with a systematic approach, starting with the basics and diving into
          intricate details. When I'm not delving into code, you'll often find
          me indulging in my passion for gaming on the computer. I believe in
          the wisdom of Occam's Razor, where simplicity is often the key to
          solving complex problems. As a perpetual learner, I'm always on the
          lookout for the latest developments and breakthroughs in the
          ever-evolving tech landscape. While I may not have a slew of notable
          accomplishments just yet, my determination is unwavering. Beyond the
          digital realm, I enjoy the art of culinary creation, experimenting
          with flavors in the kitchen and baking up a storm. Join me on this
          journey as I combine my diverse interests to create innovative digital
          experiences that make a positive impact.
