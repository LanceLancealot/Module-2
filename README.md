In the **Work** section, I showcase some of my projects that demonstrate my skills in web development. Each project item includes a title, an image, and a link to the live project. The grid layout allows visitors to explore my work in an organized and visually appealing way.

## Contact
The **Contact** section provides information on how to get in touch with me. It includes a link to my email and my GitHub profile, making it easy for visitors to reach out for collaboration or to learn more about my projects.

## Styling
The styling for this website is defined using CSS. A custom stylesheet (`style.css`) has been created to ensure consistent and visually pleasing design elements throughout the site. The color palette chosen consists of dark and light blue shades, creating an engaging and professional appearance.

## Responsive Design
The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. Media queries have been utilized to adapt the layout and styling as the screen width changes. The navigation menu is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing, enhancing user interaction.

Feel free to explore the live website and view the code in this repository to learn more about me and my projects. If you have any questions, ideas, or opportunities for collaboration, I'd be happy to hear from you!
